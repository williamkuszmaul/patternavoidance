/*
 *  hashmap.h
 *  A very simple hash map implementation for storing pairs
 *  (unsigned long long, payloadsize byte object) Only has insert and
 *  lookup ability. No update or delete.  Uses linear probing,
 *  which often yields better performance than c++ unordered map.
 *  Will throw error if -1 is inserted as a key. (Is only screw case)
 *  If a key is inserted multiple times, it will be stored multiple
 *  times; Is undefined which payload will then be returned for
 *  lookups. (This could easily be made better if it mattered for a
 *  usage case)
 *  Note: Does not call any kind of destructor on payload object when hash table is destructed. So payload object cannot have pointers which need to be freed.
 *
